# FootballData

This project is not finished yet.

Using a RESTful API, this programme creates and updates an SQL table of all goalscorers in the Premier League. Data stored is then used to plot graphs for the top scorers in their position.

This project isn't completed yet and will be updated with new features whenever there's time to work on it.

Some ideas for the future are:
* Interlace with some other data to try and predict outcomes of matches
* Django website for data found
* Make data collected available for PowerBI
* GUI



Football data provided by the Football-Data.org API
